# React Assessments

In the following assessments, we will break down the process of building a to-do list. We'll begin by using `create-react-app`, `React`, and `state` and `props` to create the outline and the functionality of the main page. We'll then add `Redux` to the project for state management and finally add `axios` and `react-router-dom` so we can hit an API and have multiple routes.

## Assessment 1

### Summary

In this assessment, we will use `create-react-app` to begin our to-do list application. To complete this assessment your application must be able to:

* Keep track of tasks using `state`.
* Use a map to list out all `tasks` on state.

## Assessment 3

### Summary

In this assessment, we will add `axios`, `redux-promise-middleware`, and `react-router-dom` to the project. We are going to refactor `assessment 2` to hit an API instead for managing tasks. We are also going to create a `details` route that will show more details about a task.
