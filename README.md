# React Assessments

In the following assessments, we will break down the process of building a to-do list. We'll begin by using just `create-react-app` and `React` to create the outline of the homepage. We'll then add `Redux` to the project for state management and finally add `axios` and `react-router-dom` so we can hit an API and have multiple routes.

## Assessment 1

### Summary

In this assessment we will create the basic outline of the main page.
